  <p align="center">
    COMRADE is a high-security, local-first cyber-operations platform engineered for developers, security researchers, and privacy advocates. 
    By leveraging AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption, zero-knowledge credential storage, offline AI intelligence, and a sidecar IRC relay daemon, 
    COMRADE ensures your sensitive assets and communications remain mathematically inaccessible to unauthorized entities.

## 🛠️ Core Features

* **Zero-Knowledge Vault Architecture**: Encryption and decryption occur strictly in memory via AES-256-GCM and Scrypt KDF. Master keys reside solely in volatile RAM and are never written to disk.
* **Kernel Stealth (Ghost Mode)**: On Windows, utilizes `SetFileAttributesW` to flag the stealth vault as a **System Protected** component invisible even if "Show Hidden Files" is enabled.
* **Anti-Forensic Wiping**: Implements a secure-erase protocol where source assets are overwritten in-place with high-entropy cryptographic random bytes (`secrets.token_bytes`) before physical deletion.
* **Offline AI Intelligence Assistant**: Driven locally via Ollama (`qwen2.5:1.5b`), enabling private context reasoning, code audits, and operational assistance without sending telemetry out of network boundaries.
* **Stealth Sidecar IRC Relay**: Built-in end-to-end encrypted chat interface connecting locally to an Ergo IRC daemon (`127.0.0.1:6667`) for private channel communications.
* **Zero-Knowledge Password Manager**: Encrypted local credential database featuring high-entropy 20-bit password generation, encrypted JSON backups, and self-destructing 10-second clipboard memory.
* **Operational Integrity & Process Locks**: Employs cross-platform file locks (`fcntl` on Linux/macOS, handles on Windows) to prevent concurrent instances from corrupting vault manifests.
